In his mid twenties, Paul Norbert was diagnosed with bipolar disorder – an often misconceived and vilified condition with far reaching effects.

“Compared to other health problems bipolar and depression are still often affected by misunderstanding and stigma. It can affect every aspect of your life and your relationships,” Paul reiterates, “I want to be open and honest about the condition and help others who might be going through something similar. Many people don’t know what to say but just a few words of kindness can make a difference, even just asking how you are.”

Paul, now 44, held down a job as a driving instructor for many years but eventually succumbed to his diagnosis and is working hard to get back on track. He is especially grateful for the support of Seven Families.
