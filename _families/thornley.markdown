In 2013 Nikki’s husband turned 40. To celebrate they decided to head off around Europe, child free for a couple of weeks, on two motorbikes. Unfortunately they never made it out of Scotland.

Nikki was paralysed in a motorcycle accident that has left her unable to work since.

“I'm still not exactly sure what happened. I lost control of my bike and hit a car. After a couple of days in a Borders hospital, I was transferred to the National Spinal Unit in Glasgow. I spent the next 11 months and 1 week (yes, I was counting!!) there away from my husband and two small boys. I don't remember anyone actually telling me I would never walk again, I think it just became apparent over time” said Nikki.

“The biggest change to my life has been the transition from being someone who is so fiercely independent to having to ask for help, and I’m still trying to get my head around that now. It has been really difficult, especially when I see our cars flying around with their blues and twos on. However, I’m looking forward to going back work part-time, whatever it is I can do. As long as I’m able to add something I just want to get back to work.”
