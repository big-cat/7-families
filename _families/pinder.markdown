Daniel Pinder was born deaf in November 1964 (he turns 50 this month) and was also diagnosed with epilepsy while young, neither of which stopped him from working as a rehabilitation officer.

In 2009, however, he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. “Many years earlier I had briefly lost sight in my left eye and experienced different short term episodes until I originally thought I suffered a stroke. When the confirmation finally came in July 2009 that it was MS it came as a relief, because until then nobody could tell me what was really happening,“ Daniel said.
