                                    Seven Families is a charity led campaign to provide a tax-free income for one year to seven people who have lost their income because of a serious or long-term illness or disability.

                                    We aim to highlight the need for people to plan financially in case they become too ill to earn an income and the charity Disability Rights UK are working with seven families where the main breadwinner has been forced out of work by an accident or illness and not received any related insurance pay out.

                                    The campaign has three aims: To raise public awareness of the financial impact of long term illness or disability; to help seven real families who are facing financial meltdown; and to demonstrate the value of independent living support, rehabilitation and counselling, through trying to help get people back to work.
