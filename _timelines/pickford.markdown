    Meet Paul. Our third family member, a self-confessed workaholic

    Paul suffered a brain stem stroke which turned his world upside down and is now treating recovery as a full time job.

  text: Here we meet Paul's rehab assistant, Emma, whose help with every day activities
    like eating and dressing, as well as physical and speech therapy, helps to relieve
    some of the pressure on the Pickfords relationship and maintain the positivity

  text: As Paul’s rehabilitation progresses, a new piece of equipment allows him to
    communicate and maintain contact with the world. Eyegaze technology offers a lifeline
    to Paul and thousands of other adults and children worldwide. As well as enabling
    the user to access the internet and email amongst other things, Paul can generate
    speech by typing a message - giving him a voice.

    Paul and Vicky open up to camera in this emotive film about their life situation. Their courage and determination really come across and it's also plain to see that Paul's speech is improving.

    This has only been achieved through a massive amount of hard work by Paul and Vicky and the professionals working with them. They know there is much more work to be done to realise Paul's full potential, whatever that turns out to be, and to come to terms with a new life that they never imagined.

  text: The determination that Paul shows to rediscover his speech is inspiring, as
    he works on it everyday, something that the consistent support of 7 Families allows
    him to do.

  text: Meet Paula, a case manager, who helps the Pickfords with anything and everything
    needed for Paul’s rehabilitation. She was even responsible for helping Paul get
    his standing frame, so she’s probably won herself a lifelong fan there.
