  text: Meet Nikki, a police officer and mother of two, who lost sensitivity in her
    lower body after a motorcycle accident and was left wheelchair bound. Nikki is
    hoping to return to work in the police station in the near future and with the
    support from Seven Families can now afford to take the time she needs for rehabilitation.

  text: As Nikki considers going back to work again in a few months, she ponders how
    her colleagues will react to her after her accident. Brimming with positivity
    and smiling as ever, she hopes others will not feel the need to tiptoe around
    her.

  text: Nikki unveils plans for the new family home that Phil has helped design. What
    was once intended as a chance to give the two boys their own room will now be
    built on a single floor, enabling the whole family to share the same living spaces
    and give Nikki access to the entire home. There’s also a few heartfelt words on
    Phil’s amazing continued contribution, and how his presence and support has given
    Nikki the strength she’s needed to focus on her rehabilitation.

    Watch as Nikki welcomes Phil across the finishing line at Land’s End after cycling 1,000 miles from John O’Groats.

    Following Nikki’s accident Phil and the ‘Joggle4Jinx’ team of friends and colleagues come together to raise approximately £9,000 for Spinal Research UK, and Spinal Injuries Scotland. The amazing effort and hard work is rewarded with a bottle of champagne, warm hugs, and a lot of emotion.

  text: Nikki and the boys have opened their doors to a new bustling, bundle of mischief
    – Cooper, the German Shorthaired Pointer. Cooper, like all puppies, is hard work,
    but at least he seems to be keeping Devon and Louis busy.
