    Daniel Pinder was born deaf in November 1964 (he turns 50 this month) and was also diagnosed with epilepsy while young, neither of which stopped him from working as a rehabilitation officer.

    In 2009, however, he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. “Many years earlier I had briefly lost sight in my left eye and experienced different short term episodes until I originally thought I suffered a stroke. When the confirmation finally came in July 2009 that it was MS it came as a relief, because until then nobody could tell me what was really happening, Daniel said.

  text: Daniel travels to Exeter to meet with his case manager, Jonathan from 7Families,
    to discuss returning to work and the options available to him to facilitate that
    process. A magnanimous man, Daniel wants to help those who, like him, suffer from
    hearing problems and multiple sclerosis – because, as Daniel says, "Life does
    not stop; Life continues."

  text: With the financial support of 7families, Daniel has been able to pay for HBO
    (hyperbaric oxygen therapy) — a treatment for multiple sclerosis that simulates
    an underwater pressure chamber. With the increased levels of oxygen in his blood
    from this treatment, he has increased feeling, mobility and a better quality of
    life.
