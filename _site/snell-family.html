<p>Until last summer Graeme Snell was a fit and healthy Hartlepool United fan. He worked full time as an Advanced Health and Wellbeing Practitioner and described himself as being very fit.</p>

<p>In July 2014 he had a double stroke and although he hasn’t worked since he has been described by medical staff as a ‘walking miracle’.</p>

<p>Graeme said: “There is no doubt that my level of fitness helped the recovery, and I dread to think what condition I might be in if I didn’t keep fit. There are some ongoing symptoms but overall I’m keen to return to work as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“The money from the project will help with day to day life. I will be taking voluntary redundancy in the spring and would like to return to work in some capacity before the end of the year, which is why the rehabilitation and support also provided by the project could be so important.”</p>
